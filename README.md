- 👋 Hi, I’m Anne-Laure aka @Teusia
- 👀 I’m interested in Segmented telescope wavefront sensors
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SCAO for exoplanet imaging
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Phasing simulations at large, my dream is to have a decent platform to do phasing wavefront sensor preliminary designs
- 📫 How to reach me ... I mean it is the heart of the problem isn't it ;)
